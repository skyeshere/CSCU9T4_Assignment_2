This repository is just so i can store my assignments somewhere not on my local machine(s) and have them accessible for future reference and so on

This assignment is for CSCU9T4, Managing Information, and is the second assignment for this module. 

You'll find:
    - source code (App/src)
        - App.java
        - Projects.java
        - Scotia_Visual_Productions_Projects.csv
    - libraries / dependencys (App/lib)
    - vsc launch.json (App/.vscode) This is so I can pass in command line arguments (you will need this)
